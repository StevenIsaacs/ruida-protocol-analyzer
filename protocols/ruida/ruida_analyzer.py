'''
Protocol analyzer for Ruida data transported via a UDP connection. This
dissects Ruida commands and replies in UDP data packets to produce a human
readable log of events and their relative timing.

This version is intended to be used from the command line to process UDP
session data previously captured using tshark (Wireshark CLI). See decode
for more information.

    NOTE: It is possible for the host to send several packets to the controller
    without waiting for an ACK. This means replies can be delayed and interleaved
    with command packets. Because sequence numbers are not part of the protocol,
    missing packets cannot be detected. Because of this the analyzer considers
    not waiting for an ACK to be a source of potentially difficult to diagnose
    timing errors. Therefore, sending packets without waiting for a reply to a
