# Ruida Driver — Test Plan (L4–L7)

> **Status:** Draft  
> **Document type:** Test plan  
> **See also:** [`RuidaDriver-functional.md`](./RuidaDriver-functional.md) for behavioral specs, [`RuidaDriver-design.md`](./RuidaDriver-design.md) for architectural intent

---

## 1. Overview & Setup

### 1.1 Purpose

Verify the complete L4–L7 stack of the Ruida Driver implementation, covering:

- **L4 — Transport Layer**: UDP/USB packing/unpacking, handshake state machine, swizzle/checksum
- **L5 — Session Layer**: Connection lifecycle, status monitor state machine, auto-reconnect
- **L6 — Driver Layer**: Script parsing/encoding, command execution, file checksum logic, machine status tracking
- **L7 — Application Layer**: TUI interactive testing, AppAdapter interface compliance

### 1.2 Environment Setup

| Component | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Python virtual environment** | `source .venv/bin/activate` (required for `rpa-script --tui`) |
| **Primary test tool** | `rpa-script --tui` (interactive TUI for session management, command entry, status/reply display) |
| **Secondary test tool** | `rpa` (protocol analyzer for capture/decode of UDP traffic) |
| **Debugger** | VSCode (`launch.json` available at `.vscode/launch.json`) |
| **Controller** | Ruida RDC6442S (or similar) on known IP, e.g. `192.168.1.100`, reachable via Ethernet |
| **USB (optional)** | Ruida controller connected via USB serial, device e.g. `/dev/ttyUSB0` |
| **Network capture (optional)** | `tshark` via the `./capture <ip> <file>` Bash script |

### 1.3 Test Environment Assumptions

- A Ruida controller is available on the local network at a known IP address (e.g. `192.168.1.100`).
- The controller is powered on and idle (not executing a job).
- For USB tests, the controller is connected via USB and the device file is known (e.g. `/dev/ttyUSB0`).
- No other application is communicating with the controller during testing.
- The Python virtual environment (`.venv`) is active for all `rpa-script` commands.

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Objective** | Verify that `_package()` produces correct swizzled output for a given raw command bytearray. |
| **Prerequisites** | `RdTransport` instance configured for UDP transport (no socket needed — call `_package()` directly on test data). |
| **Steps** | 1. Prepare a known raw command bytearray (e.g., a `CORE NOP` command).<br>2. Call `_package(data)`.<br>3. Compare the output with the expected swizzled byte sequence. |
| **Expected result** | The output matches the expected swizzled sequence. |

#### Test 2.1.2: `_package()` — Checksum Computation (UDP)

| **Prerequisites** | As above. |
| **Steps** | 1. Call `_package(data)` on a known bytearray.<br>2. Extract the first 2 bytes and interpret as `struct.unpack(">H", ...)`.<br>3. Compute the expected checksum from the swizzled payload. |
| **Expected result** | The extracted checksum matches the expected value. |

#### Test 2.1.3: `_package()` — No Checksum for USB

#### Test 2.1.6: `_unpack_replies()` — Unexpected Second Byte
- [x] Test 2.1.6

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Objective** | Verify that a chunk with valid `0xDA` header but non-`0x01` second byte fires `UNEXPECTED_REPLY` and is truncated. |

## 6. Integration: Live Capture & Decode Verification

### Test 6.1: TUI + GET_SETTING + Simultaneous Capture [ ]

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Objective** | Verify that commands sent from the TUI appear correctly in a simultaneous network capture. |
| **Prerequisites** | Controller on network. `rpa-script --tui` ready. `./capture` script available. |
| **Steps** | 1. Start a packet capture: `./capture 192.168.1.100 integration-test.log` (in another terminal).<br>2. In TUI, start a session: `session start udp=192.168.1.100`.<br>3. Send a command: `GET_SETTING MEM_CARD_ID`.<br>4. After reply appears, stop the capture.<br>5. Run `rpa integration-test.log` to decode. |
| **Expected result** | The decoded capture shows the GET_SETTING command followed by a reply. The command bytes match expectations. |

### Test 6.2: Capture Decode Verification [ ]

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Objective** | Verify that `rpa.py decode` correctly interprets the captured traffic. |
| **Prerequisites** | Capture file from Test 6.1. |
| **Steps** | 1. Run `rpa integration-test.log`.<br>2. Examine the decoded output for the GET_SETTING command and its reply. |
| **Expected result** | Decoded output shows the command mnemonic (`GET_SETTING`), memory address (`MEM_CARD_ID`), and the reply value. |

### Test 6.3: Round-Trip — Script → Encode → Transmit → Capture → Decode [ ]

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Objective** | End-to-end verification: an `.rds` script is encoded, sent to the controller, captured on the wire, and decoded back to the original script form. |
| **Prerequisites** | Controller on network. `rpa-script` CLI available. |
| **Steps** | 1. Create a simple `.rds` script file (e.g., `CORE NOP`).<br>2. Run `rpa-script script.rds -o tmp/encoded-output` to produce tshark-format output.<br>3. Pipe the tshark output through `rpa.py` to decode: `rpa tmp/encoded-output`.<br>4. Alternatively, send the script live and capture with `./capture`, then decode with `rpa.py`. |
| **Expected result** | Decoded output matches the original `.rds` commands (round-trip fidelity). |

## 7. Problem Reporting Procedure

When a test fails, follow this procedure to document the issue:

### 7.1 Capture TUI Log Output

- Take a screenshot or copy the TUI log text.
- If the TUI is still running, scroll back to capture all relevant log entries.
- Note the exact sequence of commands that led to the failure.

### 7.2 Record Session Details

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **`rpa-script --tui` command** | Full command line used to launch |
| **Session commands** | Exact text of each command entered |
| **Controller IP** | IP address of the Ruida controller |
| **Transport type** | UDP or USB |
| **Timestamp** | Date and time of test |

### 7.3 Note Unexpected TUI Behavior

Specific symptoms to document:

- Widgets not updating (log frozen, side panel stale, counters not incrementing).
- TUI hang / unresponsive input.
- Exception tracebacks (copy the full traceback text).
- Unexpected event sequences (e.g., `DISCONNECTED` without a cable event).

### 7.4 Protocol-Level Issues

If the issue appears to be at the protocol/wire level:

1. Capture UDP traffic with `tshark` using the `./capture` script:
   ```
   ./capture 192.168.1.100 problem-capture.log
   ```
2. Run the capture through `rpa.py`:
   ```
   rpa problem-capture.log
   ```
3. Compare the decoded output with expected command byte sequences.
4. Inspect the verbose output (`problem-capture-vrb.tshark`) for raw hex dumps.

### 7.5 Code-Level Issues

If the issue is in Python code:

1. Open the project in VSCode.
2. Set breakpoints in the relevant layer files:
   - **L4**: `ruidadriver/rd_transport.py`, `ruidadriver/transport/`
   - **L5**: `ruidadriver/rd_status.py`, `ruidadriver/rd_session.py`
   - **L6**: `ruidadriver/ruida_driver.py`, `rpascript/interpreter.py`, `rpascript/encoding.py`
   - **L7**: `rpascript/tui_adapter.py`, `rpalib/app_adapter.py`
3. Reproduce the failure under the debugger.
4. Capture stack traces and variable state.

### 7.5a Using Introspection for Diagnostics

The `!` introspection commands provide a powerful diagnostic tool for understanding the internal state of the driver stack during a test session:

- **Check connection state**: `!session.is_connected` — returns `True`/`False`
- **Inspect driver status**: `!driver.machine_status` — shows decoded address:value map
- **Examine transport state**: `!transport.is_open` — returns `True`/`False`
- **Test encoding directly**: `!transport._package 0xDA0100` — manually invoke wire-format packaging
- **Inspect any object**: Use `!<path>` to walk the object graph starting from: `session`, `transport`, `driver`, `status`, `parser`, `decoder`
- **Self-inspect**: Use `!self.<attribute>` to inspect TuiAdapter TUI internals (e.g., `!self._event_count`)

Introspection output appears in the main log area with `[INFO]` prefix. Errors (unknown objects, attribute errors, type errors) are logged as `[ERROR]` without crashing the TUI.

### 7.6 Report Template

When reporting a failure, include:
